# orca

A JAVA port of the ORCA algorithm by Tomaz Hoƒçevar as described in the paper

	A combinatorial approach to graphlet counting (2013)

This is a pretty straight port of the C++ code published here:

## Use

Use [Jitpack](jitpack.io) to include in any maven projects.  

Have a look at the unit tests to see how the library is called. It's not super-user
friendly at the moment. If you'd like to use this, drop me a note or make an issue,
and I'll see if I can tidy it up a bit.
